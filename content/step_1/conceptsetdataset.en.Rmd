description: "These are multiple datasets, one per each conceptset, which is a value in the list c(conceptsets_exact_matching, conceptsets_children_matching), set in 07_algorithms. Each conceptset dataset is named after the conceptset. Each conceptset is associated to a list of codes. The dataset is obtained by retrieving records from the CDM bearing a code that match one of the codes in the codelist. The matching can be exact (for the conceptsets in conceptsets_exact_matching) or per ascendant (for conceptsets in conceptsets_children_matching) . Records are retrieved from the EVENTS table, but also from other tables which may bear a record, such as PROCEDURES or VACCINES"
